		<h2>About Baby Groot</h2>
		<p>Baby Groot is so cute! He died saving his friends, but then survived! Baby Groot is an infant of Groot from the first <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>. He is a crucial member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. He brings joy and laughter and life would be sad and dull without him. He speeks in Groot language which mean all he says is, "I am Groot". Like many children he has some anger issues, but he also has a nice and sweet side to him. Groot is one of a kind, but don't be fooled by his puppy dog eyes, because he is small and mighty.</p>
